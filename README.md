# BEMSolver
This program is for calculating Blade Element Momentum(BEM) which is used to divide each blade into small 2D airfoil elements, analyze the forces on these elements using blade element theory, and then relate these forces to the overall momentum change of the air flowing through the rotor disc via momentum theory.
